#Wmail

A Mac app wrapper around Google Inbox and GMail. Multiple account support, unread notifications and more. Makes using Google Mailboxes feel that little more native on osx.

### Installing
WMail should work just by running it like any other app. If you have Gatekeeper enabled on your mac you will need to make an exception to run the WMail app the first time. Here are some instructions if you're unsure how to get started

1.) After downloading the app, unzip it if your browser hasn't already done it automatically.

2.) Drag WMail into your applications folder

3.) Double click on the app to launch it. Depending on your configuration you may see a warning dialog from Gatekeeper that the app is from an unidentified developer

4.) Dismiss this warning and open System Preferences. In here select the "Security & Privacy option

5.) You'll notice at the bottom of the window it informs you that WMail wasn't opened because it's from an unidentified developer. Press open anyway to launch the app

6.) Once you've done this the first time you'll be able to launch the app from applications at any time

### Building from source

Feeling brave and want to build from source? Here's what you need to do

Firstly you need to get a client id and secret from Google. Visit https://console.developers.google.com to get started. You'll need to setup your OAuth Client ID and enable the Gmail, Google+ and Identity Toolkit APIs.

Next create `src/shared/credentials.js` with your google client id and secret like so...

```js
module.exports = Object.freeze({
	GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID : '<Your google client id>',
	GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: '<Your google client secret>'
})
```

Then run the following...

```
npm install
npm start
```
