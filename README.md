### Building from source

[![Travis Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/Thomas101/wmail.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/Thomas101/wmail)

Feeling brave and want to build from source? Here's what you need to do

Firstly you need to get a client id and secret from Google. Visit https://console.developers.google.com to get started. You'll need to setup your OAuth Client ID and enable the Gmail, Google+ and Identity Toolkit APIs.

Next create `src/shared/credentials.js` with your google client id and secret like so...

```js
module.exports = Object.freeze({
	GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID : '<Your google client id>',
	GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: '<Your google client secret>'
})
```

Then run the following...

```
npm install
npm start
```
